# Mechanema

"Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth." -- Archimedes

Mechanema are (simple) machines. In ancient Greece, it was believed that there
were just a few simple machines. Hero of Alexandria in his _Mechanics_ listed
them as: lever, windlass, pulley (tackle block), wedge, and screw. With just these
five machines, one could in theory set any object into motion. During the
Renaissance, these simple machines were described as the basis for all other
machines.

Within this repository, find several opinionated libraries that, like those simple
machines of antiquities, can help put something in motion -- namely your own
progress. These libraries correlate to the "simple machines" of classical
mechanics. Each provides a way to reduce boilerplate and help you focus on making a
React/Redux application.

While it's not required, these tools were built to work in a [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) (or [re-ducks](https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks)) layout.
