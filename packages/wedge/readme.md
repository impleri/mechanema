# Wedge

In classic mechanics, the wedge was used to separate two objects (or portions of a
single object). It could also lift up or hold up a single object.

With Redux, this wedge is primarily used for separating slices within a store. This
is done by providing some basic methods to create a reducer slice as a state
machine, as well as aggregate everything into a root reducer.
