# Pulley

In classic mechanics, the wedge was used to lift heavy objects by distributing and
transmitting force.

With Redux, this pulley is primarily used for supporting movement and change of
direction in the mutation of a Redux store. This is done by providing some basic
methods to create a epics (aka sagas) and aggregate them into a root watcher.
